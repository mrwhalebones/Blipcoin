"So.... The system for this is pretty much the backbone of raw transactions themselves. A simple system like those nifty Bitcoin
ATMs could probably be made to scan raw paper transactions. My thought, is to allow for a paper mempool upload and check server.
Mind my terminology, I'm a bit sleepy, no coffee today yet.

Anyways, here's what I see and I'm going to push this as a proposal with some basic code written out to help implement the End-User
experience:

A simple add-on to the Qt executable or the Bitcoind(daemon) executable, or even standalone using JSON-RPC functions and building
upon the QR scanner already in the master source, to be able to scan transactions written out by hand. I'm going to try pulling 
what photo/handwriting analyzing libraries and opensource projects I can into my research scope and see what I can put together
that actually functions.

Long run, we need some dude living on the streets, motivated enough, to be able to do the calculations, and be able to mine a
block. We need someone living in the mountains, to be able to cruise into town, and keep their farm running by mining a block.
This system wasn't built to be taken over by big banks, but to push them out of the picture and allow the general public to
decide where and how to control their own "money". Money just being the physical example of the amount of work/time/ideas that 
get put into furthering this world and humanity. 

Alright, I think I got the idea out there a little better."
